## DEC-004 — Notification channels reduced to EMAIL + SMS; WhatsApp and Zenvia removed; SMS migrated from Twilio to MobileMessage

**Date**: 2026-04-21

**Decision**: The platform supports exactly **two** notification channels:
- **EMAIL** via Resend
- **SMS** via MobileMessage (https://mobilemessage.com.au/)

WhatsApp (Zenvia provider) is **out of scope for v1** and all future work until explicitly reinstated. Twilio is replaced by MobileMessage as the sole SMS provider.

**Supersedes**:
- `specs/009-notifications/spec.md`, `plan.md`, `data-model.md`, `tasks.md` — all mentions of WhatsApp, WHATSAPP channel, Zenvia provider
- `projeto-consolidado/escopo-v2.md` — references to "Twilio ou Zenvia"
- `projeto-consolidado/regras-negocio-respostas-cliente.md` — business rules referencing WhatsApp
- `CLAUDE.md` §10 (notification channels) and §15 (integrations)

**Rationale**: The operations team confirmed only MobileMessage is in use for SMS and there is no WhatsApp deployment agreement. Removing the channel eliminates dead code, a phantom DB enum value, and three unused env vars.

**Implementation**:
- `packages/shared/src/enums/notification.ts` — `WHATSAPP` removed from `NotificationChannel`; `WhatsAppApprovalStatus` enum removed.
- `apps/backend/prisma/schema.prisma` — `WHATSAPP` value dropped from `NotificationChannel` enum; `whatsapp_approval_status`/`whatsapp_approval_reference` columns dropped from `notification_templates`.
- `apps/backend/src/modules/notification/infrastructure/zenvia-whatsapp.provider.ts` — deleted.
- `apps/backend/src/modules/notification/infrastructure/stub-whatsapp.provider.ts` — deleted.
- `apps/backend/src/modules/notification/infrastructure/twilio-sms.provider.ts` — replaced by `mobile-message-sms.provider.ts`.
- `apps/backend/src/modules/notification/infrastructure/webhook-signature-validator.ts` — Twilio + Zenvia validators removed; MobileMessage Basic-Auth validator added (pending provider confirmation of webhook signature spec).
- Routes: `POST /v1/webhooks/zenvia` removed; `POST /v1/webhooks/twilio` → `POST /v1/webhooks/mobile-message`.
- Container: wired to `MobileMessageSmsProvider`.
- Env: `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`, `WHATSAPP_API_KEY`, `WHATSAPP_API_URL`, `ZENVIA_WEBHOOK_SECRET` removed; `MOBILE_MESSAGE_API_KEY`, `MOBILE_MESSAGE_SENDER_ID`, `MOBILE_MESSAGE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` added.
- `specs/009-notifications/tasks.md` — T120, T121 marked obsolete (WhatsApp fields removed at source); T171 marked obsolete (Twilio/Zenvia removed, MobileMessage T171b added as DONE once webhook spec confirmed).

## DEC-003 — OP role scope restored to cross-tenant

**Date**: 2026-04-19 (QA revalidation + auth-middleware fix landed in staging commit `bfdef83`).

**Decision**: OP is **cross-tenant** per `CLAUDE.md §6` ("Operator, cross-tenant, operational team"). OP JWTs carry `tenant_id: null`. Use cases that need tenant scoping for OP either (a) honour a `?tenantId=` query filter (list endpoints: appointments, properties, service regions, etc.) or (b) pin to `actor.tenantId` when it's present. AM is the other platform-wide role.

**Supersedes**: every "OP is tenant-scoped" / "Sprint 1 W-4-IMPL (CORRECTION-001 close-it, 2026-04-13)" note embedded in the following specs:

- `specs/001-identity-access/spec.md`
- `specs/001-identity-access/contracts/user-endpoints.md`
- `specs/002-tenants-branches/plan.md`
- `specs/005-service-groups-marketplace/plan.md`
- `specs/009-notifications/spec.md`, `tasks.md`, `contracts/notification-endpoints.md`
- `specs/015-permissions-rbac-matrix/spec.md`, `research.md`
- `specs/021-contacts/plan.md`
- `specs/GAPS.md` (entry for CORRECTION-001)

**Rationale**: the `CORRECTION-001 close-it` on 2026-04-13 introduced an `auth-middleware` guard that rejected any OP JWT without a `tenantId`. Since nothing in the provisioning flow assigns a `tenant_id` to OP users, the guard broke every OP request as soon as staging picked up the change. QA flagged it on 2026-04-19 as a release-blocking regression. Revert + QA retest confirmed OP cross-tenant is the correct operating contract, consistent with the canonical `CLAUDE.md`. The list endpoints that had coerced `actor.tenantId!` for OP (dropping `?tenantId=` filters silently) were fixed at the same time (commit `bfdef83`, Bug C-B2).

**Implementation**:
- `apps/backend/src/shared/interfaces/auth-middleware.ts` — guard removed; comment records the contract.
- `apps/backend/src/modules/appointment/application/use-cases/list-appointments.use-case.ts` — OP branch now honours `filters.tenantId`.
- `apps/backend/src/modules/service-region/application/use-cases/list-service-regions.use-case.ts` — same pattern for service regions (Bug C-B1).

**Follow-up**: the per-spec "tenant-scoped" notes can be edited out in a future editorial pass; this entry is the source of truth for now.

## DEC-002 — `/time-slots` is an admin management page

**Date**: 2026-04-21 (final hardening pass).

**Decision**: The `/time-slots` standalone page is strictly for managing (CRUD) appointment time slots. Permitted roles: **AM, OP, CL_ADMIN** (backend `CreateAppointmentTimeSlotUseCase` / update / delete already enforce this). CL_USER cannot access this page or the admin-list endpoint. CL_USER reads time slots only through **`GET /v1/time-slots/effective`**, which is consumed by the appointment form to populate dropdowns, and which correctly includes CL_USER (spec `012-appointment-time-slot/contracts/time-slot-endpoints.md`, FR-077).

**Affected surface**:
- **Route guard** (`apps/web/src/app/router.tsx`): `[AM, OP, CL_ADMIN]` — already correct.
- **Sidebar** (`apps/web/src/components/shell/Sidebar.tsx`): under the Configuration submenu gated to AM/OP — already correct.
- **Backend `list` use case** (`apps/backend/src/modules/appointment-time-slot/application/use-cases/list-appointment-time-slots.use-case.ts`): previously allowed CL_USER by mistake; tightened to `[AM, OP, CL_ADMIN]` to match spec 012 contracts line 56 ("CL_USER and INSP are forbidden").
- **Backend `list-effective` use case**: remains open to CL_USER for form consumption.

**Rationale**: the previous state (admin page route=AM/OP/CL_ADMIN, backend list accepted CL_USER as dead code) created a phantom mismatch that kept surfacing during RBAC audits. Aligning the backend with the spec removes ambiguity and closes a minor defense-in-depth gap.

## DEC-001 — Contacts standalone page accessible to all four roles (read)

**Date**: 2026-04-21 (final hardening pass).

**Decision**: `/tenant-contacts` (the standalone Contacts page) is readable by **AM, OP, CL_ADMIN, CL_USER**, with CL tenant-scoping enforced by the backend. Contact create/update is restricted to **AM, OP, CL_ADMIN** per spec `021-contacts/spec.md` FR-001. CL_USER continues to create contacts **inline** during appointment creation (appointment form autocomplete → new contact path) — it does not require the standalone page for write.

**Affected surface**:
- **Backend list** (`apps/backend/src/modules/appointment/application/use-cases/list-appointment-contacts.use-case.ts`): already allows `[AM, OP, CL_ADMIN, CL_USER]`.
- **Route guard** (`apps/web/src/app/router.tsx`): already allows `[AM, OP, CL_ADMIN, CL_USER]` (set during Block B/C round).
- **Sidebar** (`apps/web/src/components/shell/Sidebar.tsx`): **updated** — Contacts is now a top-level nav item gated to all four roles. It was previously buried under the admin "Users" submenu scoped to AM/OP, which hid a feature CL roles had full access to.

**Rationale**: the read API was already reachable by CL users via tenant-scoped listing; hiding the entry point in the sidebar created the exact "route accepts / sidebar hides" ambiguity flagged during the final hardening pass. Exposing the nav item resolves the mismatch without changing any permission model.
